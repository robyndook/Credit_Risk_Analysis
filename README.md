# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17: Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk
## Project Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 

## Resources
[.csv](https from github)

## Results
Six machine learning models to describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores 

### RandomOverSampler

![image name](https from github)

- High Risk: Precision = 0.01, Recall = 0.72
- Low Risk: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.56

### SMOTE algorithms

![image name](https from github)

- High Risk: Precision = 0.01, Recall = 0.62
- Low Risk: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.69

### ClusterCentroids algorithm

![image name](https from github)

- High Risk: Precision = 0.01, Recall = 0.69
- Low Risk: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.40 

### SMOTEENN algrithm

![image name](https from github)

- High Risk: Precision = 0.01, Recall = 0.72
- Low Risk: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.58

### BalancedRandomForestClassifier

![image name](https from github)

- High Risk: Precision = 0.04, Recall = 0.67
- Low Risk: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.91

### EasyEnsembleClassifier

![image name](https from github)

- High Risk: Precision = 0.07, Recall = 0.91
- Low Risk: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.94

## Summary
- Analysis shows all models used show a feeble precision in determining a high credit risk. 
- Ensemble Classifier shows improvment of the sensitivity in high credit risk, however, the low credit risks falsely detected compared to the high credit risk.  
- Based on my analysis summary I would not recommend any of these models.
